Fast fast forward merge( no change in existing file only created new file is called fast forward merge)
recursive merge ( Master brancch me file already hai aur feature b branch create karne ke baad feature b me bhi file show hone lagegi,
aur phir hum maste1r me master wali file(jo master branch me bani hai) me change karenge to wo recursive merge hoga) 
( jab two branch me file hoti hai aur change sirf ek branch me hota hia tab isko recursive chane bolte hai)

Coflict merge  ( jab master branch me bhi same file (file1) me change ho aur feature-c branch me bhi file1 me change ho and then merge 
feature-c branch to master then it will be confilct merge )
