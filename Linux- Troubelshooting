==================
The Apache server allows 150 concurrent connections by default and drops any further additional requests. Since you are using default configs, this is most likely why the server couldn't handle 1000 requests at the same time.

To alter this configuration, we can use the Apache MPM module.

1. MPM has 3 modes: prefork, event, and worker. Please run the below commands to confirm the mode of MPM currently enabled on your server: 
   apache2ctl -V
   a2query -M

   Worker mode is the most widely used and recommended. Based on the output, we can change the mode if needed.


<IfModule mpm_prefork_module>
StartServers 5
MinSpareServers  5
MaxSpareServers 10
MaxRequestWorkers  150   ( INCREASE TO 1500 )
MaxConnectionsPerChild   0
</IfModule>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
seroadmin@riyadhotp:~$ cat /etc/apache2/mods-available/mpm_prefork.conf

     It is allowing a maximum of 150 concurrent connections.

      Applllication logs are writen in storage in real time that can slow the server performance.
